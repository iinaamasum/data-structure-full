/**
 * Given the root of a binary tree, make a function named void level_order_reverse(Node* root) and output the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).
For example:

Sample Input:
5
3 1 2
9 -1 -1
20 3 4
15 -1 -1
7 -1 -1
Output: 15 7 9 20 3
